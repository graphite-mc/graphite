# Graphite
> A modern render engine for Minecraft (1.8.9) 

**Note**: Graphite is still in a super early stage of development. It is not for production. 

## Technology
Graphite takes advantage of [wgpu](https://wgpu.rs) and its bindings for Kotlin ([wgpu4k](https://github.com/wgpu4k)) to entirely rewrite the rendering engine with this API. 

## Milestones

* ~~Get 2D rendering working.~~
* Get UI working.
* Get 3D rendering working.
* Make the world render. 
* Make entities render. 
* Make the sky render (with clouds.)
* Make the miscallaneous stuff like hand render. 
* Get HUD working (including chat). 
* Shaderpack support. 
* OptiFine feature backport. 
* Render API for other mods.
